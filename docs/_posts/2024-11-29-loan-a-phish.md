Time for our Black Friday post!
We need to be prepared an increase in phishing and other forms of attacks 
in the period starting on
Thanksgiving shopping season and going through Christmas and the New Year.
Today's is one of those I would be watching out for: offering a loan.

Scams in general, and phishing specifically, do not only come in emails. 
In fact, we have already talked about phishing using a
[text message]({% post_url 2023-12-08-swiss-phish-message %})
and by phone (they left a
[voicemail]({% post_url 2023-10-20-talkie-phish  %})).
Today's example is more of the latter. 
Instead of impersonating the 
[Federal Trade Commission](https://www.ftc.gov), we have, well, something!

> No longer wish to proceed. Please. Feel free to let us know as well. When you give us a call back. Make sure to mention your application ID just for a faster process. Your application ID is a is an apple, H as in Hotel, C is in zebra 34578. Once again, that number is a as an apple, H as in hotel C, is in zebra 34578. And also just a reminder. My number is 877-867-5139. I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon. Thank you so much and have a wonderful day. 

The recorded voicemail (I made a
[mp3 version of it](/sounds/2024/voicephish_20241129.mp3)), may be better than
my lousy transcribing skills.

## How do I know this is phishing call?

- The first clue is: were you shopping for loans? If not, stop right there,
  and delete the message. 
  The idea of this scam is: who would not want some extra money to spend
  on gifts to the loved ones?
  Sounds inviting, right? But, if you were planning for that, shouldn't 
  you be talking to your bank or some company you researched instead of
  just answering a voicemail from who knows what?

- The second clue is the phone number. I will let you on a hint: whenever
  I see a phone number I do not know, I do not just call them back with 
  my credit card and driver's license in hand. I search for the phone number
  online to see if I can find if the company they claim to be really is who
  they are. In this case, I searched for `877-867-5139` and found an entry
  with the Better Business Bureay 
  [about them](https://www.bbb.org/scamtracker/lookupscam/913491)
  which says this scammer is claiming the person she is calling (who we
  affectionally call the Clueless Phish) applied for a loan with them.
  I know as a fact the person who submitted this phishy entry has not
  applied for loans in years. I also find interesting the person reporting
  that to BBB did so on November 20, 2024. That would indicate this is not
  an isolated attack.

If you cannot find the number after searching online, assume it is 
  not legitimate. If they claim to come from a company you have heard of
  (Microsoft, FTC, American Expess, IRS, etc), you can always look 
  their number up in their official website.

As always, not matter what the voicemail is about, do not just call them
back. Let your brain do some thinking. And then do some investigating.
