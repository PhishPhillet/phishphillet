Today's phishing email is a variation of the classic Nigerian Prince scam. 
The basic hook is greed. The Nigerian Prince (phisher) asks you (phish) 
to help him
move massive amounts of money by depositing them into your account and you
then send him his share (which is the only real money: yours) *before*
your bank checks if the transfer is real.
In this variation, the phisher is offering you a easy but high paying job,
which also requires you to believe they send you money so you will in turn 
send your hard-earned cash as commission.

## What are the dead giveaways this is a phishing email

- The email in the `From:` field, `support@vitalnourishlife.com` has 
  absolutely nothing to do with the one in the body of the email,
  `nico.nego@nicnegometalworks.com`. 
  The domain `nicnegometalworks.com` sure does not look like
  `vitalnourishlife.com`.

- If you want to do some further
  investigating, you will find the domain `nicnegometalworks.com`  was
  registred/created in the 21st of September of this year (2025).
  That usually makes me blink, so I checked their website (yes they do
  have one, but I was very careful checking it) which claims company's
  website has been around since 2021. My math may not be that great
  but 2025 is not 2021.

- Why would such company be contacting you for this offer?

- The English is not particularly good.

- As mentioned before, the EZ-Money hook is strong: work part time, making
  $5000/month + commission without any required skills (accounts receivable
  position with a contract ready to be signed)? Yeah right.
