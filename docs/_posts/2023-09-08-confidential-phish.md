While this is not *technically* a Nigerian Prince phishing email -- its 
claimed country of origin is two countries South of Nigeria -- like the
[beautiful masterpiece](https://phishphillet.com/blog/2023/07/21/we-got-a-nigerian-phisher.html)
we talked about in a previous post, it is one in spirit. 
Take a look at the email, posted here in glorious ASCII, and see if you agree with
me.

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to you from Gabon, I am a personal cook to the Deposed 
President of Gabon who is under house arrest.

I have a vital information I can release to you now , You will stand 
the position to claim the consignment that is in Turkey as the owner 
of the consignment, Is deposited as a Personal Valuable Item and bonded 
by the chief of staff to the president who is also under arrest, during 
the arrest he gave me the file to keep, from there I got this information 
and the receipt of the deposit.

I have all the full details, the reference number, the security code 
numbers, if you mention this information you will reclaim the consignment. 
Confidentiality what is in the boxes (Two) is cash valued ($26m) each.

We are under house arrest now in Gabon in Central Africa.

If you are interested contact me so I will give you the details of the 
Security Company so you can reach them with the information as the owner 
of the consignment, the security code number is the title proving you as 
the owner.

When received I and you will invest it as partners in your company.

## Identifying this as a phishing email in easy steps

Clearly is it not in the same league as the true blood
[Nigerian phishing](https://phishphillet.com/blog/2023/07/21/we-got-a-nigerian-phisher.html)
email we looked at some weeks ago, but you must admit it has its
own charm:

- The consignment of the consignment is a consignment?
- This is not about royalty; it deals with a lesser president. But he was
deposed and is in house arrest. Close enough, don't you think?
- However, there was a real military coup in Gabon. On August 30, 
President Ali Bongo Ondimba was removed from power. 
Our phisher is aware of the news; props for that.
- No *kindly* today. I feel sad.
- This phisher is pretending to be just a lowly cook. Can't be that lowly
because he is *personal cook* and is also supposed to be in the same house 
arrest as Mr. President. Also, he signs off as a "consultant."
- We cannot rely on the odd grammar as indicator of phishing because our
phisher phriend is supposed to be from Gabon, were they speak French and not
English (in addition to local languages). Still,
"*Confidentiality what is in the boxes (Two) is cash valued ($26m) each*"
gives a smile to my face. 

Overall, it is a bit convoluted to the point I do not know if it would be an
effective phishing email. However, as entertainment I give it high marks.
