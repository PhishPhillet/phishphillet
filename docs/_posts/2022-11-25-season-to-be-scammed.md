It is Black Friday! And We are in the Season to be Scammed! A few moments 
ago (I am typing this as fast as I can) I received the following phishing 
email

<img src="/images/2022/phish4.png" class="align-center" 
alt="Phishing email claiming victim won a yeti cooler">

It's call to action is the claim 
Dick's (insert jokes here) Sporting Goods 
decided out of the blue to give me a Yeti cooler if I just click on 
the "*Confirm Now!*" link. I usually would spend the time and look at the 
email's source to see if it has any interesting teltale signs of phishing. 
But, this phisher is so lazy he does not deserve a deep dive on the email. 
So, let me count the ways this is a scam:

1. Why would Dick's want to send me a cooler? They do have a store here but I make my point not to go there. So they do not know I exist... unless they bought my name off a list. If that is the case, I feel I should ignore them even more.
1. Why is the name in the return address "Dicks SportinGoods" (blue line) instead of "Dicks Sporting Goods"?
1. Why is the domain of the return address celimopafeseda (red line)? I could say that I could not find that domain registered anywhere I bothered to look (spent some extra time I really did not need to for this article), but let's be honest: this has nothing to do with dicks.
1. If I had spend time and looked at the email's header, I would have seen it was sent through outlook.com. But I will not. I am not saying mailed through Outlook is a telltale of a phishing email but I do not like how the path it took while inside their network is obscured. Still, short post this is.

As a result, I think we can safely label this as phishing and move on.

I am disappointed for the lack of pride this phisher has. Do you think some other phisher will redeem my faith on them or is this the best I can expect this Friday?
