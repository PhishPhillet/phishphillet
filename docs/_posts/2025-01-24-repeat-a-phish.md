I (at last!) am getting a lot of similar emails recently.
Here is one of them. At first, it seems rather harmless: just some company
spamming me about some AI course. Try to read it (come on, it is not that long!)
and make a point to remember
the gist of the email, it's `Subject:` and the email address (the `From:`)
of the person sending it.

FYI (Geek Alert!), CET is Central European Time, which is 1h ahead of 
"0000" (a.k.a Zulu (Z)
or [Universal Time (UTC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Time), 
the time zone at 0Â° longitue). 
In other words, these two emails arrived 10 seconds apart;
sure makes you wonder.

Also, while the email address changed, and it is talking about ChatGPT instead of
Microsoft Copilot, the email itself does look similar to the previous one,
doesn't it? 

## Ok smart guy, two does not a pattern make

Right you are! How about another one? I promised while I removed the links,
 I kept the format of the
email down to the hashtags (which probably were meant to be one per line).

But wait! There is more! I could fill this post with more samples but that
does not add any value. Instead I will just post a few more headers:

I think I made my point. 

## Identifying them as phishing emails

- Lots of slightly different emails. We covered that but it is worth mentioning
  again. 
  One of the reasons to use multiple email addresses is to make it hard for
  the not-so-bright -- most of them -- spam filters to block them.

- The email addresses in the `From:` field look like a bunch of words slapped
  together. To use one of the addresses in the emails I pasted above,
  if a company is called **Socialteers**, chances are it would not use 
  `cloud.socialteers-fhada.com` as its domain. Besides, what does 
  "Socialteers" have to do with teaching?

- The reason they picked AI because it is the buzz word of the moment: 
  everyone plus his cat is either making some gimmick with the "AI" word on
  it or is teaching about it.

- Some of these emails were sent not very far, timewise, from each other.
