I wanted to say this was a slightly more clever than that average phishing 
email but I can't. Of the "*legal repercussions*" style of phishing emails, 
the 
[FTC voicemail](https://phishphillet.com/blog/2023/10/20/talkie-phish.html) one
was better. Still, it deserves to be mentioned. 
Let's take a look at it and then tear it apart:

Dear CLUELESS PHISH,

Your credit file has been updated.

What does this mean?
One of your credit cards is over its maximum limit. Spending more than your credit limit allows can negatively impact your FICOÂ® Score, particularly if you
 allow it to carry over in to future months.

What should you do next?
Log in to your account to review your credit file. If you don't recognize this activity, or need further assistance, please reach out to us at 1-XXX-XXX-XXXX.

Sincerely,

## Identifying this phishing email
- Let's start with the basics: do you have an American Express credit card?
If not, why should you be receiving an email from them saying you are exceeding
a card limit? "*Maybe they are warning me about another card?*" Well, then, I 
will take your bait: this would work if you have subscribed to the 
"*American Express MyCredit Guide*". Have you? Great, go to the next bullet 
point. I haven't, so I would call this what it is -- phishign email -- and
treat it as it deserves.
- So let's say you do have subscribed to the "*American Express MyCredit Guide*"
service. Fine. Then don't click on the email link and log into that site. And
see if it actually reports something unusal. It does? Great, go address it.
It does not? Great, so you know what this email is.
- Is that phone number legit? I don't know; I do not have that service. But, I
would expect if I went to the real "*American Express MyCredit Guide*" website
(and, no, I am not going to bother looking for it), I would find their official
phone number.
