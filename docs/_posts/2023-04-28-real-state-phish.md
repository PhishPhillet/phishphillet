Some phishing emails are bad, some are really bad, and then some are like
watching a train wreck in slow motion level of bad. Guess which group today's
email belongs to?

class="align-center" alt="[Phishing email claiming to be from CVS and yet the Subject says it is Real State in Thailand]">

This time I will not paste the text version of the email (I might add it late). 
Let's instead just go right into business:

## Why this phishing email is a disaster

Oh, let me tell you the ways!

- It claims to be a CVS email asking you to click on the survey link so you
can receive its malicious payload. Nothing special here; a lot of phishing
emails do that.

- The `Subject:` of the email has nothing to do with CVS or surveys in general.

- The `Subject:` of the email is about some Real State Property in Thailand. 
So, Mr. Clueless Phisher, what are you trying to impersonate: a real state or
a CVS email? Were you in a hurry and merged two distinct phishing campaigns 
together? 

- The grammar is also entertaining. I will let you pick your favourite bit.

## Come on, Man! Does it have any redeeming features? 

OK, if I had to pick one thing I liked, it is the sentence (I am trying
hard to preserve the lack of grammar and the upper/lowercase usage)
