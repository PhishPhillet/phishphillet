You probably have noticed we have not philleting new phishes recently. 
The reason is really simple: we do not receive many phishing emails, and those
who have provided us with some of the previous phishes have not been able to
send us more.

We need help. We need your phishing emails. 
If you receive one, please send them to us at phishes@phishphillet.com 
(you can send it as an attachment so to preserve its glorious phishyness).

Don't be stingy! Share your phish!
