I belong to a few meetup groups. For the last two months I have seen
an interesting phishing message being posted as a new post/discussion to
a few meetup groups.
This type is to offer, as they state, an *easy reliable work*, which
translates to providing personal information (so the phisher can get loans and
credit cards on the phish's name) or installing some malicious software 
disguised as the app required to perform work duties.

## Why this is phishing 

- What's App as the only means of contact. I am yet to find a legitimate
  business which can only be contacted using What's App.

- "*Get paid while you train*" I see so many ads like this, specially from
  companies who supposedly are offering some kind of bootcamp.
  Yes, most bootcamps are scams; the ones offering 
  "*garanteed job placement*" doubly so.

- No proper job description. What do you want people you want to hire to do?
  We just had a [phishing email similar to this](https://phishphillet.com/blog/2025/11/28/represent-a-phish.html)
  that took the time to put the job title. Is this too much to ask?

- The fact I have seen about 12 of these posts. They all have the exact same
  wording, changing only the fake phone number, username, and profile picture.
  If I had only seen one such post, I would have let it pass. But when you
  see the same post on 3 groups within 15 minutes of each other, you do
  start wondering. And then the same post is, well, posted again in the same
  groups but with the changes I mentioned ("*Hey! I am a completely different
  post. The author's name and picture looks completely different!*"), I stop
  wondering.
