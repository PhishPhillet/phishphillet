I belong to a few meetup groups. For the last two months I have seen
an interesting phishing message being posted as a new post/discussion to
a few meetup groups.
This type is to offer, as they state, an *easy reliable work*, which
translates to providing personal information (so the phisher can get loans and
credit cards on the phish's name) or installing some malicious software 
disguised as the app required to perform work duties.

## Why this is phishing 

- What's App as the only means of contact. I am yet to find a legitimate
  business which can only be contacted using What's App.

- "*Get paid while you train*" I see so many ads like this, specially from
  companies who supposedly are offering some kind of bootcamp.
  Yes, most bootcamps are scams; the ones offering 
  "*garanteed job placement*" doubly so.

- No proper job description.

- The fact I have seen about 12 of these posts, who only change the fake phone
  number, username, and profile picture.
