Another cookier cutter phishing email. You are probably thinking 
"*man, he is really scrapping the bottom of the barrel here.*"
Yes I am; this site depends on contributions from readers like you!

Back to the email, let's see if you recognize the pattern:

Dear sir/madam,

## Identifying this as a phishing emails without breaking a sweat

- This is the classic email where either 
  - They send you a check to buy stuff that is way more than needed. Then they
tell you to keep some and send the rest back.
  - They will send you some *training programs* pre-infected with malware.
- *Kindly* never seems to go out of fashion with phishers.
- Yes, the `Subject:` is just **Re**. Nothing more. Really?

There is nothing more interesting about this phishing email. Mt Phisher
completely fail to impress me, or anyone currently alive.
