It has been said before that true classics are timeless and touch everyone 
regardless of race, colour, or language. 
I do not think that was originally intended to include phishing emails, but
here we are.
Every so often a kind soul will contribute with something in a different 
language, like the email below:

## I've heard of a phishing email just like that before.

Right you are, man on the sofa in your underwear. 
This at first glance is the ol' 
[prize scam](https://consumer.ftc.gov/consumer-alerts/2023/04/are-you-really-lucky-winner-spot-prize-scams),
where someone is promised some kind of award that requires some "processing
fee/taxes" in advance, which you can then pay by providing them with your
credit card info.  That's the bait. 
The attack part of the phishing starts when the receiver of the email
 (the phish, the victim) bites by clicking on the link.
Not only the attacker can get the credit card info (not as valuable as it
used to be when this scam was new) but also personal information that 
can be used to steal the phish's identity. And perhaps download some malware 
while at it.

## Enough about the theory. Show me how to identify this as phishing email
Remember that
a good phishing email is like a good marketing email (I am using *good* here in a very specific way; I do not like receiving either. Ok, I do like receiving 
phishing emails because without them this blog, and your entertainment, 
would not be possible) must show scarcity and time contraint 
("*you must call now or will lose an opportunity of a lifetime!*")
in addition to
a valuable prize so Clueless Phish will act impulsively before brain has time
to catch up and go "*oh, wait a minute!*"
Thing is, this email fails at that:

- It says they are giving out prizes every week. That is a lot of prizes, at
  least 52 in an year. Are they all (*fantastic*) iPad Pros, or are they 
  also offering socks,
  plastic cups which smell you can't get rid of
  no matter how many times you wash them, 
  and ugly sweaters as prizes for the other weeks?
  After all, if they hand out an iPad Pro every single week, why would anyone
  feel special enough? They should have said "yearly" to really rub in the 
  rarity aspect of this "prize." If you are going to rub it in, rub it nice 
  and hard.

- It thanks the Clueless Phish for participating in this event. 
  Yes, my first reaction was "*Aha! I did not enter any context!*"
  Thing is, it is quite possible, specially if you live in the US, that 
  a company you did business with (think cell carrier, supermarket, some
  website) sold your information to unscruauplous data traders
  (are there scropulous ones?), who in turn would sell your personal 
  information and buying habits to whoever waves money at them.

- It wants the Clueless Phish to submit as much as personal information as 
  possible within 48h of receiving the phishing email. That is a lot of time:
  I could probably cook a meal which would require me to learn how to do it 
  and get the ingredients first, and then eat it, and then spend the night 
  suffering in the bathroom, and I would still have time to ponder on the
  email. By then my brain would have prepared and shown a presentation on
  why clicking on that is a bad idea. 
  Where's the panic?
  If **I** was writing that, the deadline, I would have made it no more than 
  24h.

- Unfortunately I cannot judge how badly it destroys the German grammar 
  because I am not that good in the German language. Good enough to read
  without translating, not good enough to judge.
  Experience tells us, however, that it probably makes a native speaker's
  ears to cringe.

So, overall this is a standard phishing variation of a prize scam which was,
as is standard with so many phishing emails, put together in a substandard way.
