Phishing is everywhere, and it has been increasingly almost exponentially.
Why? Because it works!

# What is phishing?

Phishing is a type of attack in which an attacker will usually 
-- but not necessarily -- send an email trying to coerce people to 
do something they would otherwise not do, such as sending sensitive information
(think passwords, bank account info, credit card numbers, personal/medical
information, and so on)
or installing malicious software such as viruses or ransomware.

Phishing can target individuals or entire companies: 
many of the largest data breaches started with a phishing email.

# What is a phish?

Phish is the target, or victim, of a phishing campaign. 
It is the mermaid guy logo of this website.
It may be *you*!

# Don't be a phish!

If you receive an email, call, or message that sounds a bit odd or was not
expected,

1. Slow down
1. Don't click on any links or download any attachments.
1. Does the email make sense?
1. Did you expect an email like that?
1. Do you have a way to verify the source? Who send this to you? By verifying I mean contacting who the email claims to come from using their official contact info, not what is in the email.

We hope our little phishing website will entertain you, and just maybe
help you learn how to identify
when an email is phishy so you will not be phished.

# We need your help!
Every single email we posted (and make fun of) here is a 100% certified 
phishing 
email. Problem is, we only receive so many of them; it seems phishers do
not like us. We would love to post more, but we can't phillet phishers 
without phishing emails.
This is where *you* can help!

Did you receive a phishing email, or want to know if a suspicious email
is indeed phishy? 
Don't let them spoil your day! Let us turn it into some entertainment!

Send us your
<b><a href="mailto:{{ site.email | encode_email }}" title="Feed the Phish">Phishing Email</a> </b>
so we can phillet it for you!

## Exciting Note
We will remove your identifying information before posting it, 
stating it was contributed by a "viewer like you (thank you!)."
If
you want to be acknowledged for the submission, 
do let us know
how you would like to be called. If you have an avatar or picture you want
use to use when referring to you, do attach it to your email!
