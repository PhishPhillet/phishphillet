Phishing is everywhere, and it has been increasingly almost exponentially.
Why? Because it works!


# Don't be a phish!
We hope our little phishing website will entertain you, and just maybe
help you learn how to identify
when an email is phishy so you will not be phished.

# We need your help!
We can't phillet phishers without phishing emails!
Did you receive a phishing email, or want to know if a suspicious email
is indeed phishy? 
Don't let them spoil your day! Let us turn it into some entertainment!
Send it
<a href="mailto:{{ site.email | encode_email }}" title="Feed the Phish">to us</a> 
so we can phillet it for you!

<a href="mailto:{{ site.email | encode_email }}" title="Feed the Phish">Submit A Phishing Email</a> 

## Note
We will remove your identifying information before posting it, 
stating it was contributed by a "viewer like you (thank you!)."
If
you want to be acknowledged for the submission, 
<a href="mailto:{{ site.email | encode_email }}" title="I caught a phisher">do let us know</a> 
how you would like to be called.
